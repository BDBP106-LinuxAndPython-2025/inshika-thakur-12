following dictionary studentmarks={"Rahul":{49,58, 35,64}, "Sandeep":{80,92,94,83},"Sita":{44,65,76,54}}
Write a script to check and print the name of the student if the student has scored above
60 in all subjects."""

#in line 9: we are iterating through the dictionary and it will return a tuple
#each tuple will contain a key and it's value. The marks of the student is present as a set so
#we need to access each element of the set

#in line 10: we assume that all marks is above 60
#line 11: it accesses the marks in the set one be one.

#line 12, in this if the marks is less than or equal to 60 we will set the above_60 to false
#and if it is above_60 then it will print the student name.
