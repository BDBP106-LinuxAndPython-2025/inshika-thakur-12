"""Q2.) How does python knows where to search for packages and modules
A2.) When I try to import a module in Python, the interpreter looks for that
module in a specific order. First, it checks the current directory (where my script
is located). If it doesnâ€™t find the module there, it then looks in the folders
listed in the PYTHONPATH environment variable (if I have set one). If the module
is still missing, Python finally searches its standard library and any other
built-in locations. All these places where Python looks are stored in
a list called sys.path, which I can see and even change while my program runs"""
