#QUESTION: (1) Create a text file containing the following text and do the following actions using sed.
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language
that is widely used for web development, data science, automation,
artificial intelligence, and more.
It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and
has grown into one of the most popular programming languages in the world.
Key Features of Python
Readable and simple syntax - Python code often looks like plain English,
making it beginner-friendly.
Interpreted language - You don’t need to compile Python;
you can run your code directly.
Cross-platform - Works on Windows, macOS, Linux, and many other systems.
Extensive libraries - Python has built-in modules and
third-party packages (via PyPI) for tasks like math,
data analysis, networking, and visualization.
Versatile use cases - From small scripts to large-scale applications.
(i) Print only the lines where the word and appears.
(ii) Change all instances of the word ’language’ into ‘lang’.
(iii) Delete lines containing the word ‘is’.
(iv) Find a way to insert line numbers at the beginning of each line
(v) Remove 1st 2 lines only
(vi) Find a way to print every other line in the above file.
(vii) Substitute first instance of ‘Python’ by ‘python’ and ‘language’ into ‘lang’ using
one sed command.
